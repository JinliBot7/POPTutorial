## Overview
---
POP is an online educational platform developed by the [ROMI Lab](https://www.romi-lab.org/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ([PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)). Currently, POP consists of four simulations of canonical dynamic systems in robotics and control, with a strong emphasis on interactive learning. POP is inspired by many open-source robotics simulation platforms such as [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) and [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/). As it is designed specifically for online undergraduate education, we strive to make it **ready-to-use**, **interactive** and **informative**. 

**Ready-to-use** means that students can access the simulations without any package installation or environment configuration, which can be a nightmare for beginners. To this end, POP is developed to be a purely web-based project, which is accessible through modern browsers on PCs, mobiles and tablets. In terms of the rationale behind POP's content design, we believe that controllable and repeatable **interactions** with dynamic systems is one of the best ways for students to understand the essence of the theories in robotics and control. To make it possible, the system dynamics of the POP simulations are programmed accroding to governing physical equations. Critical terms in these equations such as force inputs,controller parameters, robot joint configurations, and spring stiffness can be altered by students through an interative user interface. As for the last attribute **informative**, it refers to this tutorial per se. POP tutorials not only provide instructions on how to play with the developed simulations, but also try to present a consise introduction to the background knowledge of each topic. The reference material and further readings are included at the end.

POP is still at a preliminary stage. The source code is mainly written in JavaScript and is available on corresponding Github [repos](https://github.com/JinliBot7?tab=repositories). Interested readers who would like to contribute to the project are highly welcomed! The web-based 3D simulations in POP are based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
